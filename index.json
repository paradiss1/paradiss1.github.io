To assess the variations on the water column turbidity and sediment transport in the Palamós Canyon linked to both natural and trawling-induced processes, an autonomous hydrographic profiler, as well as a near-bottom current meter and a turbidimeter were deployed in the canyon axis (929 m depth) from February to June 2017, covering a trawling closure (February) and trawling activities (March-June). Periods of enhanced water turbidity during the trawling closure were mostly associated with storms and DSWC events, transporting turbid dense waters into the canyon. In absence of such events, the water column displayed low suspended sediment concentrations (~ 0.3 mg L− 1) until the trawling season began, when particulate matter detachments, ranging between  1 mg L− 1 and 3.8 mg L− 1, were observed at the water depths where the trawling grounds are found. During the trawling closure, high near-bottom suspended sediment fluxes (35–44 g m− 2 s− 1) were sporadically registered at ~ 920 m depth associated with a major storm and DSWC event. Smaller but more frequent increases of near-bottom suspended sediment fluxes (0.1–1.4 g m− 2 s− 1) were recorded during trawling activities. Despite these smaller trawling-induced suspended sediment fluxes, 30 days of continuous bottom trawling activity transported a total amount of 40 kg m− 2, of similar magnitude to that generated by a major DSWC event (50 kg m− 2). Since bottom trawling in Palamós Canyon is practiced on a daily basis throughout the year, a much larger contribution of anthropogenically derived water turbidity and suspended sediment transport can be expected.","tags":[],"title":"Natural vs. trawling-induced water turbidity and suspended sediment transport variability within the Palamós Canyon (NW Mediterranean)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sarah Paradis","Claudio Lo Iacono","Pere Masqué","Pere Puig","Albert Palanques","Tommaso Russo"," others"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1636578369,"objectID":"420af6ce758821b98a3fe2c3953fd908","permalink":"https://paradiss1.github.io/publication/paradis-2021-evidence/","publishdate":"2021-11-10T21:06:09.443698Z","relpermalink":"/publication/paradis-2021-evidence/","section":"publication","summary":"Bottom trawling in submarine canyons can affect their natural sedimentation rates, but studies addressing this issue are still scarce. In the Gulf of Palermo (SW Mediterranean), bottom trawling occurs on the slope around Oreto, Arenella and Eleuterio canyons. Analyses of excess 210Pb concentrations and grain size fractions in sediment cores from their canyon axes revealed that sedimentation rates and silt contents increased in all canyons in the 1980s, due to the expansion of more powerful trawlers (500 HP) to deeper fishing grounds. In Eleuterio and Arenella canyons, sedimentation rates increased by an order of magnitude (0.1-1.4 cm·yr-1), whereas they increased less (0.1-0.7 cm·yr-1) in Oreto Canyon, since the enhanced trawling-derived sediment fluxes into this canyon are affected by sediment resuspension from trawling along its axis.

Here we investigated the biogeochemical properties of sediment from a deep-sea trawling ground in Palamós Canyon (NW Mediterranean) to assess the effects of a 2-months trawling closure in the recovery of sedimentary organic matter. In comparison to untrawled areas, the continuous erosion and sediment mixing in trawling grounds led to coarser reworked sediments impoverished in organic carbon (∼30% loss) and promoted the degradation of labile compounds (52–70% loss). These impacts persisted after the temporal trawling closure, highlighting that this management strategy is insufficient to restore the seafloor.

The physical and biogeochemical impacts of bottom trawling were studied on the continental slope of the Gulf of Castellammare, Sicily (southwestern Mediterranean), through the analysis of two triplicate sediment cores collected at trawled and untrawled sites (∼550 m water depth) during the summer of 2016. Geochemical and sedimentological parameters (excess 210Pb, excess 234Th, 137Cs, dry bulk density, and grain size), elemental (organic carbon and nitrogen) and biochemical composition of sedimentary OM (proteins, carbohydrates, lipids), as well as its freshness (phytopigments) and degradation rates were determined in both coring locations. The untrawled site had a sedimentation rate of 0.15 cm yr−1 and presented a 6 cm thick surface mixed layer that contained siltier sediment with low excess 210Pb concentrations, possibly resulting from the resuspension, posterior advection, and eventual deposition of coarser and older sediment from adjacent trawling grounds. In contrast, the trawled site was eroded and presented compacted century-old sediment highly depleted in OM components, which were between 20 % and 60 % lower than those in the untrawled site. However, the upper 2 cm of the trawled site consisted of recently accumulated sediments enriched in excess 234Th, excess 210Pb, and phytopigments, while OM contents were similar to those from the untrawled core. This fresh sediment supported protein turnover rates of 0.025 d−1, which doubled those quantified in surface sediments of the untrawled site. The enhancement of remineralization rates in surface sediment of the trawled site was associated with the arrival of fresh particles on a chronically trawled deep-sea region that is generally deprived of OM. We conclude that the detrimental effects of bottom trawling can be temporarily and partially abated by the arrival of fresh and nutritionally rich OM, which stimulate the response of benthic communities. However, these ephemeral deposits are likely to be swiftly eroded due to the high trawling frequency over fishing grounds, highlighting the importance of establishing science-based management strategies to mitigate the impacts of bottom trawling.","tags":[],"title":"Organic matter contents and degradation in a highly trawled area during fresh particle inputs (Gulf of Castellammare, southwestern Mediterranean)","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\r[13/12/2021] I\u0026rsquo;m participating in a Training Workshop organized by the IAEA on Applying Nuclear and Isotopic Techniques for Identifying and Characterizing Sources of Blue Carbon in Coastal Ecosystems to researchers from Indonesia (13-16 December).\n[24/11/2021] We\u0026rsquo;re flying out to Swakopmund, Namibia, to participate in the Ministry of Fisheries and Marine Resources monitoring survey to collect sediment cores and suspended sediment from nepheloid layers.\n[01/10/2021] I\u0026rsquo;m proud to be supervising Aline Wildberger\u0026rsquo;s master thesis (MSc Geography, Earth System Science, University of Zürich) on spatial predition techniques in heterogenous submarine canyons.

To assess whether there have been significant trawling-induced alterations in the sediment dynamics within the Foix Canyon (Northwestern Mediterranean) during the past century, sediment accumulation rates obtained using 210Pb and 137Cs radiochronology were compared between sediment cores retrieved in 1993 and in 2013 from the canyon axis at 860 m depth. The results indicate an almost two-fold increase in the sedimentation rate in the 1960–70s, from 0.5 cm·y−1 to 0.9 cm·y−1, as a consequence of the rapid industrialization of the fishing sector at that time. Sedimentation rates further doubled to 1.8 cm·y−1 in the early 2000s. This period was characterized by the construction of bigger trawlers with more powerful engines as well as the modernization of the engines of existing vessels, all of which were largely under-declared. These results provide compelling evidence of the increasing impact of bottom trawling due to the modernization of trawling fleets at the beginning of the XXIst century.","tags":[],"title":"Enhancement of sedimentation rates in the Foix Canyon after the renewal of trawling fleets in the early XXIst century","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sarah Paradis","Pere Puig","Anna Sanchez-Vidal","Pere Masqué","Jordi Garcia-Orellana","Antoni Calafat","Miquel Canals"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1636578368,"objectID":"173c589af8945ff14aadc0c91c342947","permalink":"https://paradiss1.github.io/publication/paradis-2018-spatial/","publishdate":"2021-11-10T21:06:08.786939Z","relpermalink":"/publication/paradis-2018-spatial/","section":"publication","summary":"A detailed study of 15 sediment cores from Blanes Canyon and its immediate surroundings (NW Mediterranean Sea) was conducted to compare historic sedimentation rates and evaluate the possible impact of bottom-trawling intensification on the sedimentary regimes over the past 50 years. The canyon axis and flanks, as well as the adjacent open slope, were sampled at water depths ranging from 300 m to 2200 m. Grain size, dry bulk density, and 210Pb concentration profiles were measured to assess possible changes in sedimentation rates over the last century and their temporal and spatial relationship to bottom trawling effort. Sedimentation rates in the upper canyon axis (900–1200 m) had the highest rates of 0.9–2.1 cm·yr−1, quantified since the 1970s. Farther downcanyon, sedimentation rates increased two to five times after the 1970s, from 0.1–0.2 cm·yr−1 to 0.2–0.8 cm·yr−1, which coincides with a rapid growth of the total engine power of the fishing fleet operating in the study area. The enhanced sedimentation rates occur downslope of the main fishing grounds and decrease downcanyon as the distance from trawling grounds increases. These results highlight the ability of bottom trawling to resuspend bottom sediments, leading to net erosion of the canyon rims and flanks. In turn, large volumes of sediment are advected towards the canyon’s interior, ultimately increasing sediment deposition along the canyon axis. Natural sedimentation rates at similar along-canyon distance from shore in the untrawled continental slope (900–1500 m) and in the lower canyon axis (1500–2200 m) are comparable (0.08–0.20 cm·yr−1), suggesting distance from coastal sediment sources as the main control on regional sedimentation in deeper parts of the margin. While submarine canyons have been regarded as preferential cross-margin conduits for sediment dispersal, they can also potentially function as modern depocenters for trawling-induced sedimentation.","tags":[],"title":"Spatial distribution of sedimentation-rate increases in Blanes Canyon caused by technification of bottom trawling fleet","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sarah Paradis","Pere Puig","Pere Masqué","Xènia Juan-Dı́az","Jacobo Mart\\ń","Albert Palanques"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1636578368,"objectID":"6e5f30d6fcc3ca65f5b6bd439c460e7e","permalink":"https://paradiss1.github.io/publication/paradis-2017-bottom/","publishdate":"2021-11-10T21:06:08.484063Z","relpermalink":"/publication/paradis-2017-bottom/","section":"publication","summary":"Many studies highlight that fish trawling activities cause seafloor erosion, but the assessment of the remobilization of surface sediments and its relocation is still not well documented. These impacts were examined along the flanks and axes of three headless submarine canyons incised on the Barcelona continental margin, where trawling fleets have been operating for decades. Trawled grounds along canyon flanks presented eroded and highly reworked surface sediments resulting from the passage of heavy trawling gear. Sedimentation rates on the upper canyon axes tripled and quadrupled its natural (i.e. pre-industrialization) values after a substantial increase in total horsepower of the operating trawling fleets between 1960 s and 1970 s. These impacts affected the upper canyon reaches next to fishing grounds, where sediment resuspended by trawling can be transported towards the canyon axes. This study highlights that bottom trawling has the capacity to alter natural sedimentary environments by promoting sediment-starved canyon flanks, and by enhancing sedimentation rates along the contiguous axes, independently of canyons’ morphology. Considering the global mechanisation and offshore expansion of bottom trawling fisheries since the mid-20th century, these sedimentary alterations may occur in many trawled canyons worldwide, with further ecological impacts on the trophic status of these non-resilient benthic communities.","tags":[],"title":"Bottom-trawling along submarine canyons impacts deep sedimentary regimes","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

The hydrophobic fatty acid based IL tetraoctylphosphonium oleate ([P8888][oleate]) was specifically chosen for its low viscosity and high selectivity towards transition metals. Applying [P8888][oleate] for continuous metal ion extraction with 0.1 M sodium oxalate for regeneration resulted in a process with good and stable extraction efficiencies over time. The selectivity of the IL resulted in a process in which cobalt was selectively removed from two mixed salt solutions (Co/Na, Ca/Co/K) to obtain a pure cobalt stream after stripping the IL. The performed experiments showed that the contact time of the IL for extraction and stripping strongly influenced the achieved efficiencies. The stability of the IL was tested and it was shown that the fatty acid based IL was stable for the duration of the experiment. Liposome tests showed that the IL is very hydrophobic, which limits its leakage towards the water phase, but also results in a higher toxicity towards cell membranes. Economic analysis shows that the IL based process is not (yet) economical compared to ion-exchange resins, in case demineralised water is the only product. However, if the recovery of valuable metals is also taken into account and/or if brine disposal is an issue, then continuous IL metal extraction systems must be regarded as promising alternatives.","tags":[],"title":"Continuous process for selective metal extraction with an ionic liquid","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pere Puig","Pere Masqué","Jacobo Martı́n","Sarah Paradis","Xènia Juan Díaz","Miguel Toro","Albert Palanques"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1636578369,"objectID":"0d0d4a1e8c33dd67a6d2c43ca01564d5","permalink":"https://paradiss1.github.io/publication/puig-2015-changes/","publishdate":"2021-11-10T21:06:09.60059Z","relpermalink":"/publication/puig-2015-changes/","section":"publication","summary":"The disturbance of the marine sedimentary environments by commercial bottom trawling is a matter of concern. The direct physical effects of this fishing technique include scraping and ploughing of the seabed and increases of the near -bottom water turbidity by sediment resuspension. However, the quantification of the sediment that has been resuspended by this anthropogenic activity over the years and has been ultimately transferred along and across the margin remains largely unaddressed. The analysis of sediment accumulation rates from sediment cores collected along the axes of several submarine canyons in the Catalan margin (northwestern Mediterranean) has allowed to estimate the contribution of bottom trawling to the present -day sediment dynamics. 210Pb chronologies, occasionally supported by 137Cs dating, indicate a rapid increase of sediment accumulation rates since the 1960-70s, along with a strong impulse in the industrialization of the trawling fleets of this region. Such increase has been associated to the enhanced delivery of sediment resuspended by trawlers from shelf and upper slope trawling grounds towards submarine canyons, as a consequence of the rapid technical development at that time, in terms of engine power and gear size. This change has been observed in La Fonera (or Palam6s) Canyon (one of the most prominent canyons of the region) at depths greater than 1700 m, while in other canyons not so deeply incised it is restricted to shallower regions (-1000 m in depth) closer to fishing grounds. Two sampling sites from La Fonera and Foix submarine canyons that exhibited high sediment accumulation rates (0.6-0.7 cm y-1) were revisited several years after the first chronological analyses. These two new cores revealed a second and even more significant increase of sediment accumulation rates in both canyons which occurred circa 2000 and reached values higher than 2 cm y-1. This second change at the beginning of the 21st century has been attributed to a preferential displacement of the trawling fleet towards slope fishing grounds surrounding submarine canyons, and to new technical improvements in trawling vessels, presumably related to subsidies and aids provided by the European Commission to the fishing industry.","tags":[],"title":"Changes in sediment accumulation rates within NW Mediterranean submarine canyons caused by bottom trawling activities","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://paradiss1.github.io/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
