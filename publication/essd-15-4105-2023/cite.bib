 abstract = {Marine sediments play a crucial role in the global carbon cycle by acting as the ultimate sink of both terrestrial and marine organic carbon. To understand the spatiotemporal variability in the content, sources, and dynamics of organic carbon in marine sediments, a curated and harmonized database of organic carbon and associated parameters is needed, which has prompted the development of the Modern Ocean Sediment Archive and Inventory of Carbon (MOSAIC) database (http://mosaic.ethz.ch/, last access: 26 July 2023; https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8322094, Paradis, 2023; https://doi.org/10.5168/mosaic019.1, Van der Voort et al., 2019​​​​​​​). MOSAIC version 2.0 has expanded the spatiotemporal coverage of the original database by >400 % and now holds data from more than 21 000 individual sediment cores from different continental margins on a global scale. Additional variables have also been incorporated into MOSAIC v.2.0 that are crucial to interpret the quantity, origin, and age of organic carbon in marine sediments globally. Sedimentological parameters (e.g. grain size fractions and mineral surface area) help understand the effect of hydrodynamic sorting and mineral protection on the distribution of organic carbon, while molecular biomarker signatures (e.g. lignin phenols, fatty acids, and alkanes) can help constrain the specific origin of organic matter. MOSAIC v.2.0 also stores data on specific sediment and molecular fractions, which provide further insight into the processes that affect the degradation and ageing of organic carbon in marine sediments. Data included within MOSAIC are continuously expanding, and version control will allow users to benefit from updated versions while ensuring reproducibility of their findings.},
