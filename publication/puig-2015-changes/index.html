The direct physical effects of this fishing technique include scraping and ploughing of the seabed and increases of the near -bottom water turbidity by sediment resuspension.

The analysis of sediment accumulation rates from sediment cores collected along the axes of several submarine canyons in the Catalan margin (northwestern Mediterranean) has allowed to estimate the contribution of bottom trawling to the present -day sediment dynamics. 210Pb chronologies, occasionally supported by 137Cs dating, indicate a rapid increase of sediment accumulation rates since the 1960-70s, along with a strong impulse in the industrialization of the trawling fleets of this region. Such increase has been associated to the enhanced delivery of sediment resuspended by trawlers from shelf and upper slope trawling grounds towards submarine canyons, as a consequence of the rapid technical development at that time, in terms of engine power and gear size. This change has been observed in La Fonera (or Palam6s) Canyon (one of the most prominent canyons of the region) at depths greater than 1700 m, while in other canyons not so deeply incised it is restricted to shallower regions (-1000 m in depth) closer to fishing grounds. Two sampling sites from La Fonera and Foix submarine canyons that exhibited high sediment accumulation rates (0.6-0.7 cm y-1) were revisited several years after the first chronological analyses. These two new cores revealed a second and even more significant increase of sediment accumulation rates in both canyons which occurred circa 2000 and reached values higher than 2 cm y-1. This second change at the beginning of the 21st century has been attributed to a preferential displacement of the trawling fleet towards slope fishing grounds surrounding submarine canyons, and to new technical improvements in trawling vessels, presumably related to subsidies and aids provided by the European Commission to the fishing industry."><link rel=alternate hreflang=en-us href=https://paradiss1.github.io/publication/puig-2015-changes/><link rel=preconnect href=https://fonts.gstatic.com crossorigin><meta name=theme-color content="#1565c0"><link rel=stylesheet href=/css/vendor-bundle.min.f1ecf783c14edc00c9320c205831ad8e.css media=print onload="this.media='all'"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/academicons/1.9.0/css/academicons.min.css integrity="sha512-W4yqoT1+8NLkinBLBZko+dFB2ZbHsYLDdr50VElllRcNt2Q4/GSs6u71UHKxB7S6JEMCp5Ve4xjh3eGQl/HRvg==" crossorigin=anonymous media=print onload="this.media='all'"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/10.2.0/styles/github.min.css crossorigin=anonymous title=hl-light media=print onload="this.media='all'"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/10.2.0/styles/dracula.min.css crossorigin=anonymous title=hl-dark media=print onload="this.media='all'" disabled><link rel=preload as=style href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Montserrat:wght@400;700&family=Roboto+Mono&family=Roboto:wght@400;700&display=swap"><link rel=stylesheet href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Montserrat:wght@400;700&family=Roboto+Mono&family=Roboto:wght@400;700&display=swap" media=print onload="this.media='all'"><link rel=stylesheet href=/css/wowchemy.481af39c39ffd87b2d14f39943e7c723.css><link rel=manifest href=/manifest.webmanifest><link rel=icon type=image/png href=/media/icon_hu0b7a4cb9992c9ac0e91bd28ffd38dd00_9727_32x32_fill_lanczos_center_2.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon type=image/png href=/media/icon_hu0b7a4cb9992c9ac0e91bd28ffd38dd00_9727_180x180_fill_lanczos_center_2.png><link rel=canonical href=https://paradiss1.github.io/publication/puig-2015-changes/><meta property="twitter:card" content="summary"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Sarah Paradis"><meta property="og:url" content="https://paradiss1.github.io/publication/puig-2015-changes/"><meta property="og:title" content="Changes in sediment accumulation rates within NW Mediterranean submarine canyons caused by bottom trawling activities | Sarah Paradis"><meta property="og:description" content="The disturbance of the marine sedimentary environments by commercial bottom trawling is a matter of concern.
