**[23/05/2022]** After two years of hosting this assembly virtually, I'm finally attending the EGU22 in person in Vienna! I will be presenting my recent work on the [geochemical properties of surficial sediment in the East Asian marginal seas](https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU22/EGU22-8316.html) as part of the [Biogeochemistry of coastal seas and continental shelves](https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU22/session/43000) session. 
**[17/05/2022]** I attended the [Radiocarbon in the Anthropocene workshop](https://royalsociety.org/science-events-and-lectures/2022/05/radiocarbon-in-the-anthropocene/), organized by the Royal Society. A nice reunion of scientists studying the carbon cycle in the atmosphere, soil, ocean, sediments, and biosphere using radiocarbon as a valuable proxy. Plus, my first in-person conference since COVID!  
**[21/04/2022]** I participated once again to the 2022 [Regional Graduate Network in Oceanography (RGNO)](https://www.microeco.ethz.ch/rgno_namibia_18-21/RGNO_Namibia.html) workshop focused on the Benguela Upwelling System (April 18 - May 7). Although I could only participate remotely, it's always nice to motivate future researchers into studying organic carbon in marine sediments!
**[22/03/2022]** Happy to have participated in a Training Workshop organized by the [IAEA](https://www.iaea.org) on Assessing the Vulnerability of Coastal Landscapes and Ecosystems to Sea-Level Rise and Climate Change to East Asian researchers (21-22 March).
**[14/12/2021]** I have just been granted the ETH Career Seed Grant to fund my first project: [Factors influencing the Accumulation of organic Carbon and its Transfer in Submarine canyons (FACTS)](https://biogeoscience.ethz.ch/research/theme2/facts.html). More to come during 2022!
**[13/12/2021]** I'm participating in a Training Workshop organized by the [IAEA](https://www.iaea.org) on Applying Nuclear and Isotopic Techniques for Identifying and Characterizing Sources of Blue Carbon in Coastal Ecosystems to researchers from Indonesia (13-16 December).
**[24/11/2021]** We're flying out to Swakopmund, Namibia, to participate in the Ministry of Fisheries and Marine Resources monitoring survey to collect sediment cores and suspended sediment from nepheloid layers. 
**[01/10/2021]** I'm proud to be supervising Aline Wildberger's master thesis (MSc Geography, Earth System Science, University of ZÃ¼rich) on spatial predition techniques in heterogenous submarine canyons. She will be presenting her research proposal on December 2.
