**[14/12/2021]** I have just been granted the ETH Career Seed Grant to fund my first project: [Factors influencing the Accumulation of organic Carbon and its Transfer in Submarine canyons (FACTS)](https://biogeoscience.ethz.ch/research/theme2/facts.html). More to come during 2022!
**[13/12/2021]** I'm participating in a Training Workshop organized by the [IAEA](https://www.iaea.org) on Applying Nuclear and Isotopic Techniques for Identifying and Characterizing Sources of Blue Carbon in Coastal Ecosystems to researchers from Indonesia (13-16 December).
**[24/11/2021]** We're flying out to Swakopmund, Namibia, to participate in the Ministry of Fisheries and Marine Resources monitoring survey to collect sediment cores and suspended sediment from nepheloid layers. 
**[01/10/2021]** I'm proud to be supervising Aline Wildberger's master thesis (MSc Geography, Earth System Science, University of ZÃ¼rich) on spatial predition techniques in heterogenous submarine canyons. She will be presenting her research proposal on December 2.
