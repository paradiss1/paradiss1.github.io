**[09/11/2022]** I was invited to give a talk for the Environmental Research Change Group seminar series, at St. Andrews University. I'll be presenting a compilation of my recent research (all unpublished), so if you are in St. Andrews, don't miss it!
**[02/11/2022]** Aline Wildberger successfully defended her Master thesis: "Tackling geomorphological heterogeneity: a comparison of predictors and modelling approaches to assess the distribution of sedimentary organic carbon in submarine canyons". We are now working hard to convert it into a manuscript. Stay tuned!
**[26/10/2022]** [New paper out](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2022.1017052/full) on the sediment fluxes and its composition in Palamós Canyon (NW Mediterranean) during winter storms and trawling activities.

**[10/10/2022]** Attending MARUM's Ocean Floor Symposium in Bremen. I'm presenting part of my ongoing research of the characterization of continental margins.
**[24/09/2022]** I was just awarded "Premi extraordinary" for an outstanding PhD thesis! Thanks to my supervisors Dr. Pere Puig and Dr. Pere Masqué, as well as all the collaborators who made this thesis possible.
**[13/09/2022]** It is my first-time attending an ICOS conference to present the MOSAIC database. I'm excited to get people on-board with this database, which will help constrain the global distribution of terrestrial organic carbon in marine sediments.  
**[24/07/2022]** A week after the virtual Goldschimdt conference, I will be presenting the same results in-person at the Geochemistry of the Earth's Surface (GES12), hosted at my home institution, ETH Zürich. Don't forget to drop by my poster on Monday afternoon!
**[08/07/2022]** I am attending virtually to this year's Goldschmidt! Even from far away, I am excited to present part of my current research: geodelineating the role of continental margins as hotspots of organic carbon deposition!
**[23/05/2022]** After two years of hosting this assembly virtually, I'm finally attending the EGU22 in person in Vienna! I will be presenting my recent work on the [geochemical properties of surficial sediment in the East Asian marginal seas](https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU22/EGU22-8316.html) as part of the [Biogeochemistry of coastal seas and continental shelves](https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU22/session/43000) session. 
**[17/05/2022]** I attended the [Radiocarbon in the Anthropocene workshop](https://royalsociety.org/science-events-and-lectures/2022/05/radiocarbon-in-the-anthropocene/), organized by the Royal Society. A nice reunion of scientists studying the carbon cycle in the atmosphere, soil, ocean, sediments, and biosphere using radiocarbon as a valuable proxy. Plus, my first in-person conference since COVID!  
**[21/04/2022]** I participated once again to the 2022 [Regional Graduate Network in Oceanography (RGNO)](https://www.microeco.ethz.ch/rgno_namibia_18-21/RGNO_Namibia.html) workshop focused on the Benguela Upwelling System (April 18 - May 7). Although I could only participate remotely, it's always nice to motivate future researchers into studying organic carbon in marine sediments!
**[22/03/2022]** Happy to have participated in a Training Workshop organized by the [IAEA](https://www.iaea.org) on Assessing the Vulnerability of Coastal Landscapes and Ecosystems to Sea-Level Rise and Climate Change to East Asian researchers (21-22 March).
**[14/12/2021]** I have just been granted the ETH Career Seed Grant to fund my first project: [Factors influencing the Accumulation of organic Carbon and its Transfer in Submarine canyons (FACTS)](https://biogeoscience.ethz.ch/research/theme2/facts.html). More to come during 2022!
**[13/12/2021]** I'm participating in a Training Workshop organized by the [IAEA](https://www.iaea.org) on Applying Nuclear and Isotopic Techniques for Identifying and Characterizing Sources of Blue Carbon in Coastal Ecosystems to researchers from Indonesia (13-16 December).
**[24/11/2021]** We're flying out to Swakopmund, Namibia, to participate in the Ministry of Fisheries and Marine Resources monitoring survey to collect sediment cores and suspended sediment from nepheloid layers. 
**[01/10/2021]** I'm proud to be supervising Aline Wildberger's master thesis (MSc Geography, Earth System Science, University of Zürich) on spatial predition techniques in heterogenous submarine canyons. She will be presenting her research proposal on December 2.
